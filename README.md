# Rain_In_AUS_Prediction

## Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts whether it will rain in Australia on the next day based on various meteorological features and historical weather data. The goal is to assist residents, farmers, and relevant authorities in making informed decisions and preparations, such as planning outdoor activities, agricultural practices, water resource management, and potential flood prevention measures.
